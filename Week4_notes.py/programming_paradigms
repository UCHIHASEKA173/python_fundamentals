PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS

Procedural
Object-Oriented

Many programmimng languages are multi paradigm so they 
    support multiple PARADIGMS
ie Python, Javascript, Ruby and others

PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING
    -Linear step by step actions to perform tasks
    -Tasks are often encapsulated into modular procedures (get user input, write user input
    to a file, perform a calculation, etc)
    -The concept of a procedure is implemented as 
    functions in Python: a modular callable block of code

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING     OOP
    -Object: A unit that bundles together relatable data and executable code
    -Objects are the center of focus
    -Attributes are called Data
    -Methods are called Executable Code
Class based approach to OOP:
    -A class is a blueprint for an object, like an 
    architectural blueprint
    -Objects are instances of a class
    -Many objects can be created from the same class
    -Think of classes as a custom data type
    / data structure
OOP CLASS INHERITANCE
    -Class inheritance - child classes created 
    based on parent classes
    -Usually more complex classes from simpler classes, share base code
    -ex. 
    parent class: House
    child classes: Cottage, Mansion, etc
    all inherit from house class
PYTHON and OOP
    -A string is a String object:
    an instance of the class of string, 
    with methods such as lower()
    -A list is a List object:
    an instance of the class of list,
    with methods such as pop()
    -Anything that can be assigned as the 
    value of a variable can be considered an
    object, capable of having attributes
    and methods. 
    -Functions are also objects
